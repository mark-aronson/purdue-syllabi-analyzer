          "score": 1,
          "rationale": "The course integrates Natural and Exact Sciences (ecology, environmental geology, climate science, conservation biology) with Social Sciences (environmental ethics, resource management, policy) and addresses 'costs and benefits for both individuals and societies' and 'ethical and effective manner' approaches to controversial topics, demonstrating cross-domain integration of scientific methods with social and ethical frameworks."

        "undergraduate_research": {
          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The syllabus describes learning about established environmental topics and forming opinions on controversial issues, but does not indicate that students engage in inquiry, investigation, or knowledge creation that extends beyond established answers or involves formulation of original research questions."
        },
        "community_and_global_engagement": {
          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "While the course discusses real-world environmental issues 'currently in the news,' there is no evidence of sustained engagement with communities, organizations, or structured reflection on ethical, social, or cultural dimensions through actual community partnerships or field engagement."
        },
        "leadership_development": {
          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "Although students are asked to 'form their own opinions' and explain approaches in an 'ethical and effective manner,' there is no evidence of intentional leadership practice, responsibility-taking, or analysis of leadership frameworks that would develop capacity to make decisions or influence outcomes."

          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The syllabus mentions 'topical assignments' and homework but provides no evidence of sustained inquiry, design, or problem-solving across the term. The assessment structure emphasizes exams and homework assignments rather than extended inquiry projects."

          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The syllabus does not describe significant independent or collaborative intellectual work. The 'topical assignments' are mentioned but not elaborated upon, and the grading is dominated by exams (400/700 points) and Connect homework assignments."

          "score": 0,

          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The syllabus does not describe work requiring extended analytical commitment and iterative review/response. The assessment structure is dominated by exams and homework assignments without evidence of iterative development or sustained analytical engagement."

          "rationale": "The majority of graded work consists of exams (400/700 points, 57%) and Connect homework assignments (160/700 points, 23%), which typically test knowledge recall and comprehension rather than requiring critical analysis, synthesis, or original contribution throughout the term."

        "broad_introductory_coverage": {
          "score": 1,
          "rationale": "The course covers a broad range of topics including 'ecological principles, history of conservation, natural resource management, human impacts on the environment, environmental geology, and environmental ethics' with the goal of describing 'a broad range of environmental and conservation topics,' indicating breadth of coverage rather than depth of analysis."

      "review_decision": {
        "decision": "not_approved",
        "rationale": "The course meets one pillar (interdisciplinary academics) but fails to meet minimum requirements for rigor, student agency and responsibility, and demonstrable evidence of learning. Additionally, it triggers three exclusions: it is a lower-division introductory course (12500), has broad introductory coverage focused on breadth rather than depth, and lacks a major intellectual deliverable. The course is designed as a foundational survey course rather than an advanced Honors-level course requiring sustained inquiry and significant independent work."
