The learning outcomes explicitly state understanding 'the application of physical, biological, and engineering principles for the safe use of radiation' and addressing environmental and occupational health concerns that inherently combine scientific, engineering, and social dimensions."

The course consists of lectures, quizzes, exams, and homework assignments on a required reading. There is no evidence of students formulating research questions, conducting original analysis, or producing novel findings."

Prerequisites (BIOL 110 and CHM 111) indicate building on foundational knowledge to address complex, specialized topics."

          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The course does not involve sustained inquiry, design, or problem-solving across the term. Assessment is primarily through frequent quizzes and multiple-choice exams testing comprehension of lecture material, rather than sustained investigation of a problem or question."

          "score": 1,
          "rationale": "The four homework assignments (100 points total, each 25 points) centered on Silent Spring require independent analytical work. These assignments are posted at least 2 weeks before due dates, suggesting they require substantial engagement with the text and application of course concepts."

          "rationale": "The course provides broad introductory coverage across three distinct fields (environmental, occupational, and radiological health sciences), covering 11 different topic areas from environmental toxicology to radiation dosimetry. The focus is on defining basic concepts and understanding components rather than advanced analysis."

        "decision": "not_approved",
        "rationale": "The course meets the interdisciplinary academics pillar and demonstrates rigor through advanced content and independent work. However, it triggers two critical exclusions: it is a lower-division introductory course (200-level) explicitly designed to 'introduce essential concepts,' and it provides broad introductory coverage across multiple fields rather than advanced analysis. Additionally, it fails to meet the demonstrable evidence of learning requirement, as the majority of assessment (67%) consists of multiple-choice quizzes and exams testing comprehension rather than requiring critical analysis, synthesis, or original contribution. No major project, portfolio, or public-facing outcome is present."
