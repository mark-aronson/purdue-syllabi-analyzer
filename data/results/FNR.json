It satisfies all rigor criteria (advanced 400-level content, sustained inquiry through multi-week capstone, collaborative and independent work). All three student agency criteria are met (student-defined projects, consequential decision-making, extended analytical commitment). All four demonstrable evidence criteria are met (major project worth 50%, capstone structure, public presentations, sustained assessment). No exclusions apply."
