          "rationale": "The course explicitly integrates multiple high-level domains: Natural Sciences (ecology, environmental geology, climate science, conservation biology), Social Sciences (resource management, environmental policy, societal costs and benefits), and Humanities (environmental ethics). Learning outcome 2 requires students to form opinions on controversial topics 'in an ethical and effective manner,' and outcome 3 explicitly addresses these disciplines' 'context and influence in modern societies,' demonstrating integration across Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities rather than mere coexistence."

        "undergraduate_research": {
          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The syllabus describes topical assignments and participation activities but provides no evidence that students engage in inquiry beyond established answers, formulate original research questions, analyze primary evidence, or produce original findings."

        "community_and_global_engagement": {
          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "While the course discusses real-world environmental issues like climate change and endangered species protection, there is no evidence of sustained engagement with communities, organizations, or structured reflection on ethical/social dimensions of such engagement."

        "leadership_development": {
          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "Although students form opinions on controversial topics and consider ethical approaches (outcome 2), there is no evidence of intentional leadership practice, decision-making with responsibility for outcomes, or analysis of leadership frameworks."

The learning outcomes focus on describing and understanding broad concepts rather than advanced theoretical or analytical content."

          "score": 0,

          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The syllabus does not describe any significant independent or collaborative intellectual work. The grading structure emphasizes exams (400/700 points), homework (160 points), and participation (40 points) without evidence of substantial independent projects."

          "score": 0,

While the topical assignments (100 points) might require critical analysis, their nature is not described, and they constitute only 14% of the grade. The sustained assessment structure does not clearly show that a majority requires critical analysis, synthesis, or original contribution."

      "review_decision": {
        "decision": "not_approved",
        "rationale": "The course meets one pillar (interdisciplinary academics) but triggers three exclusions: it is a lower-division introductory course (12500), focused on broad introductory coverage across six disciplines, and lacks a major intellectual deliverable. Additionally, it fails to meet the rigor requirements (no advanced content, sustained inquiry, or significant independent work), student agency requirements (no student-defined projects, consequential decision-making, or extended analytical commitment), and demonstrable evidence of learning requirements (no major project, portfolio, public-facing outcome, or sustained assessment requiring critical analysis). The course is appropriately designed as an introductory general education course but does not meet Honors teaching and learning expectations."
