          "score": 0,
          "rationale": "The course focuses solely on Agile project management methodologies within Industrial Engineering. While it mentions technology and engineering contexts, there is no evidence of integrating knowledge, methods, or frameworks from distinct high-level domains such as Social Sciences, Humanities, Business, or Natural Sciences."

          "score": 0,

          "score": 0,

          "score": 1,

        "rationale": "The course meets one pillar (leadership_development) and demonstrates advanced_content rigor, but fails to meet requirements for student agency and responsibility (no criteria scored 1) and demonstrable evidence of learning (no criteria scored 1). Additionally, the broad_introductory_coverage exclusion is triggered based on the course's emphasis on providing 'basic understanding' and 'basic principles.' These deficiencies prevent approval."
