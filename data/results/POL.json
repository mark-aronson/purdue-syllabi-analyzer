The comprehensive survey structure across 16 weeks covering history, institutions, methods, case studies, ethics, and future challenges is characteristic of an introductory overview course rather than an advanced, specialized Honors-level course."

          "rationale": "The course schedule demonstrates sustained inquiry across 16 weeks, progressing from court structure through judicial agenda setting, decision-making theories, landmark cases on rights and equality, and institutional dynamics, requiring students to analyze these topics through readings, participation, and the judicial review paper."

The course appears to have predetermined assignments without student choice in direction."

While the course satisfies rigor requirements (advanced content, sustained inquiry, and independent work), demonstrates student agency through extended analytical commitment, and shows evidence of learning through sustained assessment, at least one pillar must be met for Honors approval. The course remains within the single domain of political science without cross-domain integration, does not involve original research or community engagement, and lacks leadership development components."
