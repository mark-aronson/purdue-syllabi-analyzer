          "score": 1,
          "rationale": "Students make consequential decisions through peer review responsibilities (1B, 1E) where they provide critical feedback on classmates' work, and through responding to reviews (1C) where they must make editorial decisions about revisions, mirroring real academic peer review processes."

        "rationale": "While this doctoral professional development course meets rigor requirements (advanced content, sustained inquiry, independent/collaborative work), student agency requirements (student-defined projects, consequential decision-making, extended analytical commitment), and demonstrable evidence requirements (major project, public-facing outcome, sustained assessment), it only partially meets one pillar (leadership development). However, the critical issue is that this is a doctoral-level course (ABE 697) designed specifically for PhD students, not an undergraduate course. Honors College credit is intended for undergraduate education, and doctoral courses are categorically inappropriate for undergraduate Honors credit regardless of their pedagogical quality."
